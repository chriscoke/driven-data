# driven-data

This is a project from DrivenData.  From their website:

DrivenData brings the transformative power of data science to organizations attacking our worldâ€™s greatest challenges.
We find real world questions where data science can have positive social impact, then run online modeling competitions for data scientists to develop the best models to solve them.

The .csv files are split into the training set and test sets. For now, I'm just fitting my models on the training set (still using hold-out samples though).

The .R file runs the code to explore the data, create a model data set, and fit some models

The .html file is a brief summary of results, which is produced by the .RMD file
